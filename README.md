# The treasure of Monte Cristo
This book is about a young man who was named Dantes. Life was going great for him, he became the captain of a ship named "The Pharaon", and he had a beautiful fiancee which he was soon going to marry. But things went utterly wrong after he returned from his last voyage. When he arrived a couple days later it was his wedding, the wedding was quite rushed since he had go on another journey on the ship soon. Finally his wedding day came, and suddenly a couple officers rushed into his wedding hall and said that he is arested for treason.
The officers said that he is arrested because they found a letter signed by him saying that he's a bonapartists meaning he works for Napolean which was considered a massive crime. He knew he hadn't written a letter so he knew someone was working behind his back, under his name.
He was taken to a prison where he spent more than ten years. While he was in prison he met an old man named Faria. The old man helped Dantes find a suspect for who had written the letter that put Dantes in prison. He asked Dantes if there is someone that's jealous of him or hates him, and immediately two people came in his mind, the cargomaster of his ship, and Fernand ( a guy who liked his fiancee). He knew he had to get revenge on them, so he had to get out of the prison. The old man soon died of a brain tumour, but before he passed away, he told Dantes about a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo, he told Dantes to find the treasure, since Faria couldn't find it himself. After Faria passed away Dantes escaped the prison and was rescued by a group of smugglers. He was taken upon their ship and they let him off at the island of Monte Cristo.
 In return he helped them smuggle in some wine and cigars. He said goodbye to the smugglers and went to find the treasure. He found the cave which contained a wooden chest filled with gold coins and jewels. He took some jewells to a jeweller's shop and sold them to get some money, and bought a boat with that money. He went back to his home town and changed his name to "The Count of Monte Cristo" so that no one would find a guy named Dantes.
He wanted to find his father, but he had passed away and his fiancee was no where to be found. He decided that his next mission was to get revenge on fernand and the cargomaster that put him in trouble.
